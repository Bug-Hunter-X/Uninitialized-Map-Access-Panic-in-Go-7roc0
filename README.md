# Uninitialized Map Access Panic in Go

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: accessing a map without first checking if it's initialized.  Uninitialized map access will result in a panic (runtime crash).

The `bug.go` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.go` file provides a corrected version.

This is a critical issue because it can lead to unexpected application crashes in production. Always check for `nil` before accessing map elements.
